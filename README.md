# Future Implementation Ideas
I would like to add a search feature to allow users to look up perfume boutiques by name, country, city, or address. I would also like to implement a new full CRUD feature, bookings, that allow the users to book appointmets with a boutique. They will have access to a calendar where they can pick a date, create the booking, read their appointment date, update the appointment date, or delete the appointment completely.
